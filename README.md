# cross-stitch

The "cross-stitch" project was an experiment in drawing your own cross-stich pattern's "back-stitching," for example for outlining or for lettering. It was the precursor to my original senior thesis idea, which was a cross-stitch pattern generator that would have allowed for the aforementioned back-stitch line drawings but also would have been able to generate a pattern that uses back-stitching when converting an image to a pattern. 

Originally I had only been looking at web applications, and I found that the best free applications merely converted an image to pixel art with colors of single kinds of threads. I believed that creating a program that allows for more than one kind of stitching to be automatically generated would be a fruitful pursuit. 

I later found http://www.pcstitch.com/ which carries a ($50) product that does, more or less, what I intended to make. I downloaded the free trial to test its capabilities. This is an excellent program, and anyone who wants to make their own patterns would do well to have this tool in their arsenal! 

Since I did not want to reinvent the wheel, this project has been archived.

My new senior thesis idea is the Identity Multimedia Quilt! Read my posts about it on Medium, at https://medium.com/@RobinFriedmr.
